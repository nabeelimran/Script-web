              Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information,
              which are downloaded to your browsing device, such as your
              computer, mobile device or smartphone, when you visit our website
              or use our services. Cookies can be recognised by the website that
              downloaded them — or other websites that use the same cookies.
              This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them
              before.

              We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session
              cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and
              is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing
              user, so it’s easier to return to us and interact with our
              services. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will
              be read by us when you return to one of our sites or visit a
              third-party site that uses our services. Session cookies last only
              as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or
              a browser session).
